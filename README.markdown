# Zach does dotfiles

## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.  Some things are tidy.  Others, not so much.

## install

- `git clone git://github.com/xaque208/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`
- `cd ~/dotfiles`
- `./bin/init.py`

## thanks

This is a collection of many years of configs, ported from SVN to Git from
long ago, before I ported my configs into this system that Zach Holman
talks about in [his blog post](0).

I forked [Zach Holman's](http://github.com/zachholman)
who forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' [dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).
